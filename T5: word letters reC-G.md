recommend  vs advise
Advise is more stronger than recommend and is often used when the person is 
giving the advise is in a position of authority
I recommend.. mainly sugguest that you are trying to be helpful and is less 
likely to cause offence

recreation vs relaxation
Both those words can be used for a wide range of activities , physical and mental
but relaxation is sometime used for gentler activities than recreation
