# word about life
### Some sentenses for the next step: reading, remembering and saying
```
you must set realistic aims and objectives for yourself
an objective analysis
Can those effects be objectively measured
There was a lack of objectivity in the way that candidates were judged
You are under no obligation to buy anything
we have a moral obligation to protect the environment
to behave obscenely
He spent most of his life working in obscurity
the course teaches students to avoid ambiguity and obscurity of expression
Do they observe Chrismas
She observed that it was getting late
She observed that all the chairs were already occupied
Fitness has become an obsession with him
The media's obsession  with the young prince continues
A lack of qualifications can be a major obstacle to finding a job
You can't park here, you're obstructin my driveway
The pillar obstructed my view of the stage
Terrorists attempting to obstruct the peace process
To obtain advice, information,premission
I'll had no occasion to visit him recently
I've met him on several occasions
I enjoy the occasional glass of wine
Please state your name, age and occupation below
the bed seems to occupy most of the room
How much memory does the program occupy?
a game that will occupy the kids for hours
sugar occurs naturally in fruit
he makes the odd mistake- noting too serious
he's worked here for twenty-odd years
Prices have risen in order to offset the increased cost of material
to produce/raise offspring
an ongoing debate/ discussion/ process
an onslaught of abuse
We drive onwards towards the coast
Some people can only operate well under pressure
