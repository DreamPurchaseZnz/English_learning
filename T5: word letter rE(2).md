```
```
believe vs think vs reckon vs feel
believe is more formal than think, it is especially for talking about ideas 
that other people have; 
think is used more often for talking about your own opinion
reckon is much informal

```
```
recommend  vs advise
Advise is more stronger than recommend and is often used when the person is 
giving the advise is in a position of authority
I recommend.. mainly sugguest that you are trying to be helpful and is less 
likely to cause offence

```
```
recreation vs relaxation
Both those words can be used for a wide range of activities , physical and mental
but relaxation is sometime used for gentler activities than recreation
