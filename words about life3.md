# The end justifies the means

# some beautiful sentence used for daily life, Welcome to the world of sentence
```
sb's jaw dropped/ fell /sagged
People in the crowd were jostling for the best position
He kept a journal of his travels across Asia
It's not something I can give you rules for; you'll have to use your own judgment
Jumbled thoughts
bring sb to justice
that photo doesn't do you justice
you cannot do justice to such a complex situation in just a few pages
Her success had justified the faith her teachers had put in her
you don't need to justify yourself to me
the end justifies the means
Don't be so juvenile
an inductive argument
a theory derived inductively from the data
I indulged myself with a long hot bath
He did not agree with indulging children
He would indulge her every dream
I indulge my feelings; I so seldom have  had an opportunity of doing so
